Mon Oct 31 notes

Ideas for improving net:

1.	More layers

2.	More data (100-> 1K, 10K)
		> GPU needed here, probably

3.	Use an existing net, and then "fine-tune" one our data

		AlexNet
		VGG
		GoogLeNet
		MSRA net ?


4.	Have the bins reflect a distribution of the training data
		10 bins

For Wed:

Adam:	Work on 2., train on 1K-10K images. given Rong's code

Rong:	Work on debugging code from over weekend 

Also have work organized in one repository. If it works, I suggest the subLetNet repo at https://www.github.org/lesnikow/subLetNet.git
