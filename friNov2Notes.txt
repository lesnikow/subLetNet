friNov2Notes	

Adam:	Y	Find out how to print tf tensors in a tf session
		Y	Do a train/test split of data, rerun with 10 epochs 
			Towards 10K image dataset built
				Y 	Compute some statistics for binning
				Goal: equifrequent buckets

Rong: 	Step towards an RGB model
		Better weighting to downcast to greyscale
		Bigger net architecture
			expand W1
			3 copies of the net
		Investigate what people are generally doing with RGB, as a baseline


Med to longer term goals:	
	Move up towards a modern deep net
	Use weights from lower layers in already-trained net


Presentations: Mon Dec 5- Frid Dec 9, ~4 1/2 weeks from now
