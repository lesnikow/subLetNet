Rong talking with lab member suggestions:
	Make the error better instead of bins
		Idea:	Difference, sq difference of price

	Using 3 channels

	Data set augmentation: (goal, start with 10K, 33K, 100K, +)
		Slight rotations,
		Flipping
		Some zooming in/ out

	

Next steps Mon:

	Updating error		Rong

	Train on 3.3K, maybe bigger, see if can get delta in accuracy	Adam

	Change buckets to be one of 4 quartiles		Rong

	GPU implementation,	Adam, Rong

	Batchsize as needed to increase training speed (gpu only) ?
